# Triggers, Notifications & Events

We can monitor our repositories using triggers, notifications as well as events.

- Events are managed by eventbridge. We can create simple event rules that can invoke the targets. This is usual eventbridge stuff
- CodeCommit itself provides Notification and Triggers. Under the hood, these are based on EventBridge events.
- Triggers are more versatile than Notifications.
- We can configure notifications and triggers to all the common activities in the repositories.
- Common usecases
  - Trigger emails
  - Add the details to CloudWatch logs
  - Kinesis, S3, etc

We can create the notifications and triggers from the console and also from the CLI

## Notifications
To get the syntax for configuring notification, run the below command:

```
aws codestar-notifications create-notification-rule --generate-cli-skeleton > rule.json
```

Open the rule.json and update it as required. A sample JSON would look like this:

```
{
    "Name": "MyNotificationRule",
    "EventTypeIds": [
        "codecommit-repository-branches-and-tags-created"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:codecommit:us-east-1:123456789012:MyDemoRepo",
    "Targets": [
        {
            "TargetType": "SNS",
            "TargetAddress": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyNotificationTopic"
        }
    ],
    "Status": "ENABLED",
    "DetailType": "FULL"
}
```
Finally, run the CLI command to setup the notification
```
aws codestar-notifications create-notification-rule --cli-input-json  file://rule.json
```

## Triggers
Triggers provide more functionality than notifications. We can configure the triggers using Console as well as CLI. 

Create a JSON specification for all the triggers in a repository
```
{
    "repositoryName": "MyDemoRepo",
    "triggers": [
        {
            "name": "MyFirstTrigger",
            "destinationArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:111122223333:MySNSTopic",
            "customData": "",
            "branches": [
                "main", "preprod"
            ],
            "events": [
                "all"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Before we deploy this configuration, we can simply test it on commandline

```
aws codecommit test-repository-triggers --cli-input-json file://trigger.json
```

If this does not throw errors, we can go ahead and deploy
```
aws codecommit get-repository-triggers --repository-name MyDemoRepo
```
