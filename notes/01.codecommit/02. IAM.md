# Users & Roles
Always create IAM users for accessing code commit. These users should have minimal access to CodeCommit. Configure the SSH keys to enable this command line access.

There are three main types of access we can provide to users:

1. Read only access
2. Push code to develop branch
3. Merge pull requests to main branch

Nobody should be allowed to push directly into the main branch. 

The policies for accessing CodeCommit are quite complex. So it is best to use the AWS managed policies.
- AWSCodeCommitFullAccess
- AWSCodeCommitPowerUser
- AWSCodeCommitReadOnly

In addition to these, append the below inline policy to make sure the users do not mess with the main branch. Senior users can be allowed Merge, but never push into main branch.

Create three user groups based on these policies. Then we can create users, allowing the developers to access the repositories as required.
