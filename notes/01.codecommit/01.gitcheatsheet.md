# Git Cheat Sheet

## Git Setup
Initial setup on the development machine before you start any work. Ofcourse, install the git client.

- Set a name that is identifiable for credit when review version history
```
git config --global user.name "[firstname lastname]"
```
- Set an email address that will be associated with each history marker
```
 git config --global user.email "[valid-email]"
 ```
 - Set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing
 ```
 git config --global color.ui auto 
 ```
 
 ## New Repository
 Configuring user information, initializing and cloning repositories 
 - Initialize an existing directory as a Git repository
 ```
 git init
 ```
 - Retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL
 ```
 git clone [url] 
 ```

## Stage and Snapshot
Working with snapshots and the Git staging area 

- Show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit 
```
git status 
```
- Add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage) 
```
git add [file] 
```
- Unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory```
```
git reset [file] 
```
- Difference between what is changed but not staged, with the staged content of the repository.
```
git diff
```
- Difference of what is staged but not yet committed, with the committed content of the repository
```
git diff --staged 
```
- Commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot. The -m indicates the comment on the commit request.
```
git commit -m "[descriptive message]" 
```

## Branching and Merging
Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes 
- List branches in the repository. a * will appear next to the currently active branch
```
git branch
```
- Create a new branch at the current commit
```
git branch [branch-name] 
```
- Switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory
```
git checkout 
```
- Merge the specified branch’s history into the current one 
```
git merge [branch] 
```
## Inspecting Repositories
Examining logs, diffs and object information
- Show all commits in the current branch’s history
```
git log
```
- Show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB
```
git log branchB..branchA
```
- Show the diff of what is in branchA that is not in branchB. (three dots instead of two)
```
git diff branchB...branchA
```
- Show the commits that changed file, even across renames
```
git log --follow [file]
```
- Show any object in Git in human-readable format
```
git show [SHA]
```

## Tracking Changes
Versioning file removes and path changes
- Delete the file from project and stage the removal for commit
```
git rm [file]
```
- Change an existing file path and stage the move
```
git mv [existing-path] [new-path]
```
- Show all commit logs with indication of any paths that moved
```
git log --stat -M
```
## Ignoring Files
Preventing unintentional staging or commiting of files
- Create a .gitignore file in the folder. Syntax:
```
logs/
*.notes
pattern*/
```
- System wide ignore patern for all local repositories
```
git config --global core.excludesfile [file]
```

## Sharing
Sharing code across repositories, Retrieving updates from another repository and updating local repos
- Add a git URL as an alias
```
git remote add [alias] [url]
```
- Fetch down all the branches from that Git remote
```
git fetch [alias]
```
- Merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date
```
git merge [alias]/[branch]
```
- Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch
```
git push [alias] [branch]
```
- Fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch
```
git pull
```
## Rewriting
Rewriting branches, updating commits and clearing history
- Apply any commits of current branch ahead of specified one
```
git rebase [branch]
```
- Clear staging area, rewrite working tree from specified commit
```
git reset --hard [commit]
```
## Temporary Commits
Temporarily store modified, tracked files in order to change branches
- Save modified and staged changes
```
git stash
```
- List stack-order of stashed file changes
```
git stash list
```
- Write working from top of stash stack
```
git stash pop
```
- Discard the changes from top of stash stack
```
git stash drop
```
